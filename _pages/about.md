I'm a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL), advised by Professor [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). I was a research intern at ByteDance Research, Microsoft and DIDI AI Labs. Prior to UCL, I received my M.Sc. from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests lie on Causal Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Recommendation Systems. Feel free to reach me at mengyue.yang.20@ucl.ac.uk.
