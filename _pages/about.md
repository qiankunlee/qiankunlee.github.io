I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Institute of Automation](http://ia.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences at Beijing. 

My research interests lie on Large language Model, Deep Learning and Natural Lanuage Processing. If you would like to chat about potential collaboration or common interests, feel free to reach me at liqiankun2023@ia.ac.cn.

**Note**: I also hope to find friends who like play badminton, swimming and food!
